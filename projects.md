###Analysis of Peer Group Behavior Among University Students

This work is primarily based on a survey of 177 students in an Indian University to understand peer group behaviour and engagement. The preliminary results from the survey reveal that that students’ social interactions are not limited to one but several groups, and the satisfaction levels associated with each type of group are indicative of the average time spent engaging with said group(s). Based on the results of the survey, we recognized a need for a minimally invasive smartphone sensing based approach to quantify group engagement, and provide design recommendations towards the same.

The Extended Abstract and Poster detailing the findings have been published in the proceedings of Extended Abstracts of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI EA ‘18).

The eventual aim of this project is to identify satisfactory peer interactions that enrich an individual’s social and academic life, potentially deterring social alienation and anxiety.

### Smartphone based Analyses of Familial Engagement

In this work, we report findings from a smartphone based study on Indian families aimed at investigating how members in the families interact. This involved localization through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons, activity recognition using inertial sensors, and event-triggered Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) to quantify engagement and satisfaction associated with familial interactions. The results from the study revealed that families felt equally satisfied with their familial engagement while using their smartphones as while dining together.

The work was presented at HumanSys’17, Delft, The Netherlands.
