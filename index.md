Hi! I am a Ph.D. Student working in Systems Research at [Shiv Nadar University](http://snu/edu.in), India.

For my Ph.D. research, I am Responsible for (a) Leveraging micro-events for activity and deep context mining, particularly for human-human interactions and behavior, and (b) Developing models for robust Bluetooth Low Energy based ranging for indoor environments.
