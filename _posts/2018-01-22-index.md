## News

- I have a postdoc position on **algorithmic biases** available in a joint project with the University of Amsterdam. Interviews are ongoing as of November 2017.
- The Search as Learning Dagstuhl Seminar I co-organized earlier this year was a success! I wrote a [blog post](http://chauff.github.io/2017-09-15-sal/) on some of the challenges we identified.
- I have spent my summer '17 at [Blendle](https://blendle.com/), a Dutch online news platform startup, and tinkered around with their search.
- I have been **awarded** an [**NWO VIDI**](https://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/vidi+awards/vidi+awards+2016) grant for my proposal [SearchX: Integrating search and sensemaking into large-scale open online  learning](http://chauff.github.io/2017-05-30-searchx/); this means funding for 2 PhDs and 1 postdoc position. Vacancies will be announced in early fall 2017. If you are looking for an IR PhD/postdoc position contact me!
- I attended ICLR in April '17 and [wrote a blog post about it](http://chauff.github.io/2017-04-25-iclr2017/).

## Briefly

Since 2013, I have been working as Assistant Professor (tenured as of 01/2016) at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/). Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with four PhD students 
I am supervising (Guanliang Chen, Yue Zhao, Felipe Moraes and Dan Davis), I am currently focusing on large-scale learning analytics and how to incorporate search into the learning process at scale. In 2016 and 2017 I have been awarded two prestigious personal grants by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) with a total funding of more than 1 million euros; this translates into 4-5 PhD/postdoc positions in the developing "serch as learning" research area; take a look at the [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17092) I co-organized on the topic to get an idea of what it is about. TU Delft is a very active provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground for my [Lambda-Lab](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/projects/learning-analytics/) team. To get a quick overview of the kind of questions we have recently published about, take a look at the following slides, they cover each contribution in 1-2 slides (check the speaker notes as well):
